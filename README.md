# rea-test
The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop,  of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
Developed using NodeJS.
to run it just type this command "nodemon index.js"  OR "node index.js"
I have never ignored the "node_modules" folder and i added it to the repository(incase you don't want to install all dependencies).


To test: you can add any ".txt" file inside the  "files" folder and then run the command to see the results.
